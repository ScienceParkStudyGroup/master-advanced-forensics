From [Schwacke et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molp.2019.01.003):
> The MapMan framework was developed specifically for plants with the design goal to facilitate the visualization of omicsdata on plant pathways (Thimm et al., 2004). 
> MapMan uses a simple hierarchical tree structure of terms referred to as ‘‘bins,’’ which describe biological contexts/concepts.   
> Major biological processes (e.g., photosynthesis) are encompassed in top-level bins, and each child bin represents a more narrowly focused subprocess or component 
> within the context of the parent bin. Assignment of proteins to the lowest-level (i.e., leaf) bins was preferred in order to make the annotation as precise as 
> possible, although assignment to abstract higher-level bins was supported.   
> Proteins were mostly assigned to a single bin, but for some proteins with functions in diverse biological processes it wasnecessary to correspondingly assign to multiple bins.
