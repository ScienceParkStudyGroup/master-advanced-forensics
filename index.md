## Welcome!

This lesson will guide you through two datasets related to "real-life" problems applicable to your study track (Advanced Forensic Biology, 5274ADFB6Y).  

You will see how to explore, fit linear models and build informative high-quality figures from these two datasets. All these acquired skills should be useful in your 
In turn, this newly generated knowledge can yield new research avenues and serve to answer new questions. 

We will use mostly R and its companion RStudio to perform our data analysis and visualisations. 

Before you begin, be sure you are all set up (see below). For complete information, see the Setup section. 


## Main learning objectives
- Identify good practices when designing a RNA-Seq experiment.
- Memorize the steps of a complete RNA-Seq experiment: from sequencing to analysis.
- Perform a QC of your experiment through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and sample clustering. 
- Execute a differential gene expression analysis using R and the `DESeq2` package.  
- Be able to create key plots: volcano plot, heatmap and clustering of differentially expressed genes.  
- Provide a biological interpretation to differentially expressed genes through ORA/GSEA analyses and data integration.

> ## Before you start
>
> Before the training, please make sure you have done the following: 
>
> 1. Consult what you need to do in the lesson [Setup](https://scienceparkstudygroup.github.io/master-advanced-forensics/setup.html).
> 2. Make yourself comfortable: if you're not in a physical workshop, be set up with two screens if possible. You will be following along in RStudio on your own computer while also following this tutorial on your own.
